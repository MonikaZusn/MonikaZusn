G'day, I’m Mon 👋🏽
I've recently completed a web development bootcamp with Lewagon Aus. 
I’m passionate about front end and design 🎨
I’m currently learning Javascript and REACT.
I’m looking to collaborate on new and exicitng projects. I'm keen to work with and learn from people who share my passion for code and making things look nice 😍  
Reach out and say hi.
